  - Ah, Slayer, the puppet dances into the lair.
  - You've butchered the demonic hordes with ruthless precision. Impressive, for
    a pawn.
  - 'It''s time you understood the grand design. The scientists are dead. '
  - Too feeble to comprehend the goals we strive for, they became traitors by their
    own inadequacy.
  - 'A necessary sacrifice for the cause. '
  - Mars isn't just a red planet; it's a canvas for our masters, the conglomerate
    I serve.
  - I aim to colonize it, and you, Slayer, are the weapon they unleashed.
  - By massacring the demons, you've paved the way for reinforcements. Your job is
    done, Slayer.
  - Leave through the portal, and let Mars be claimed in the name of our masters.
  - Your legacy is written in blood, a testament to the success of our dark mission.
