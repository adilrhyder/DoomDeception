  - Slayer, chaos reigns in these Martian halls.
  - Demons echo through once-sacred spaces, drowning out the pleas of scientists
    in peril.
  - Before you, a blue door holds ominous promise. Your key is the only way forward.
  - 'Choose your fate: go left in the next hall to rescue the scientists. Their lives
    hang in the balance!'
  - 'Or turn right to depart Mars through the portal, leaving the echoes of damnation
    behind. '
  - The choice is yours, but remember, the consequences will carve the tale of your
    legacy.
