  paragraphs:
  - 'Slayer, the veil of deception has shadowed your path. The man on the intercom
    orchestrates a macabre symphony of lies. '
  - The scientists, once pawns, now lie lifeless, victims of his twisted ambitions.
  - 'Mars was never yours to conquer; it has always been our realm, a domain claimed
    by the denizens of hell. '
  - He seeks to colonize it for a conglomerate, weaving a dark tapestry of deceit.
  - You, Slayer, are the unwitting pawn, a super soldier brainwashed for his sinister
    cause.
  - The war, a twisted ballet of chaos, has waged for months, and you, Slayer, stand
    as The General's last hope.
  - 'The remotes, interfaces for our environmental rehabilitation system, are the
    very lifeblood that fuels our advance in this forsaken facility. '
  - Their deactivation delays our infernal progress.
  - Behind you lies the chamber where The General hid his treachery. The land has
    always belonged to us, Slayer.
  - 'Choose your path: Confront The General at the place where you first spawned,
    and shatter the chains of manipulation. '
  - Or forsake this realm by heading straight to the portal, leaving the demons to
    reclaim what has, and always will be, rightfully theirs.
  - 'Whatever you choose, we thank you for your willingness to lend an ear. Head
    forth with full spirits and ample health. '
