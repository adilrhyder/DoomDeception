  - Slayer, you've reached the room where knowledge was promised, yet only another
    remote awaits in the shadows.
  - It seems the scientists have... relocated for their safety.
  - Deactivate the remote before you, and the truth will unveil itself.
  - May your arsenal be swift, and your purpose unyielding.
  - Return to the chamber of your awakening after. I await your coming.
