  paragraphs:
  - So, the demon has betrayed our secrets, has it?
  - No matter. Your misguided allegiance to the truth won't change the outcome.
  - You're here to confront me, to challenge the puppet master. But remember, you
    are still bound by the strings I control.
  - The truth is a mere inconvenience to our purpose.
  - Mars will be colonized, and you, my unwitting weapon, have ensured it.
